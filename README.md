## Notice

### I've been hard at work for two years revamping Diablo from the ground up to bring you the most sinister creation yet. Stay tuned for the public release >;)

## About

Official: [Devilution](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution) | [DevilutionX](https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionx)

Here you will find the first version of Devilution along with a new rewrite. This will showcase the amount of work it took to reverse engineer and complete the source.

Inside the [trivia](trivia) folder contains screenshots showing the progress of Devilution from the initial decompilation up to the June 6th 2018 release! Along with a few feature teasers ;)

The first version [2018_03_14](2018_03_14) was a raw dump from IDA that had thousands of errors fixed before it finally compiled. Executable immediately crashes when ran.

The last version [2020_03_31](2020_03_31) after two years of group efforts. This is an incomplete rewrite of Devilution from 2019 by me, with improved accuracy based off the beta.

Credits to the people who helped along the way. This project was a great learning experience and helped me develop useful skills.

## Support

I spent 3 years unemployed working many hours on Devilution. I didn't take donations and paid out-of-pocket for all the time lost.

If you want to support me, consider getting my name out. I'm looking for a job in software development! <3
